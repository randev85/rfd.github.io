				<p><i>"Flavour and authenticty can elevate something of a necessity to something of a luxury ."</i> – Rajan Randev</p>

                <p>I’ve been intrigued by food from a very young age and was privileged to have eaten great food, day in, day out, created by my mother’s hands!</p>
                <p>The role of meal times acted as an important event for both me, my father and sisters as it was a place for us to catch up with each other’s days whilst enjoying a plethora of great tasting dishes. To say that we all looked forward to it would be an understatement.</p>
                <p>Being around great tasting food inspired me to become a chef and allowed me to indulge in my curiosity for cooking and in its component ingredients.</p>
                <p>Over my 13-year career, I’ve learnt that great food doesn’t have to be expensive to demonstrate quality. Adding value to a meal through technique, flavour and authenticity can elevate something of a necessity to something of a luxury.</p>
                <p>I’ve created this website to share some of the recipes I’ve developed, to show you what you’re capable of growing in your own back garden, and to offer you healthy guidelines on the nutrients you need daily.</p> 
                <p>I’m a big believer in sustainable living. This can be done through eating seasonally, growing your own fruit and vegetables to supplement your food shop, reduction in your food waste and knowing what nutrients, vitamins and minerals your body needs to survive and thrive.</p>  
                <p>Being able to eat and live sustainably can help us all to be healthier and kinder to our planet.</p>
